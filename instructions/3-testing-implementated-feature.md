# Help me write the instruction
We have successfully implemented all the required APIs which are mentioned in 2-back-end-schema-plan.md.
Now our goal is to write test for individual features which makes our application ready for production.

## Test

### Authentication and other features

1. Register a new user
2. Login with the registered user
3. Verify the authentication token
4. Song list feature
5. Artist list feature
6. Album list feature
7. Search feature
8. Like a song feature
9. Unlike a song feature
10. Get user's liked songs feature
11. Get user's profile feature
12. Get user's liked songs feature

Make sure to write test for dto for each feature as it's the most important part of the application which checks the data structure of the response.
